Problem Statement:
    Just in nested loop just compare with i and j situation for example
    for i in list:
        for j in list:
            if i==j
                return true
     problem O(n2)
Better approach:
    Use a hashset and search if the link node is present or not
    Hashset=[i for i in list]
    for i in list2:
        if i in Hashset:
            return True
    return False
    Better approach O(n) and space complexity O(n)

Even better approach:
    first find the length of two lists
    then make the differnce between two lists
    Make two pointers
    first pointer: travel it through the difference
    then after that travel both first and second pointer at the same time and check if they two intersect
